Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate at [ICT, CAS](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), advised by [Prof. Gaogang Xie](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~_xie?language=en) and [Prof. Quan Yu](https://ict.cas.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/201903/t20190311_5253743.html). Throughout this timeframe, under the mentorship of [Layong Luo](https://luolayong.com/), I actively engaged in designing and implementing a variety of real-world applications([Tiara](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi22/presentation/zeng), [SRNIC](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi23/presentation/wang-zilong), [Faery](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi22/presentation/zeng)).
Before that, I received my B.Eng in Computer Science in [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://hust.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My research interests include **high-performance datacenter networking** (eg., RDMA) and **software-hardware codesign** for application acceleration.
<!-- My research interests revolve around software-hardware codesign for accelerating datacenter applications, including networking, computing, and security domains. -->
